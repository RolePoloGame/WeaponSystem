4. Explore the structure and the example weapon configurations.
5. Play the scene `sc_WeaponSystem` to test the modular weapon system.

## Usage
- **Adding WeaponType**: Create new instance of WeaponType Scriptable Object. 
- **Configuring WeaponType**: Create and assign Action to the WeaponType in the Inspector window. 
- **Configuring Actions**: Create and assign Module to the Action in the Inspector window.
